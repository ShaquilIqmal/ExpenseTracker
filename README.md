# ExpenseTracker
This project is developed for me to test new elements and plugins before apply in real projects. It is like a training ground. (maybe?)


To run the project:
1. Replace the DB_CONNECTION  in .env file with your own DATABASE details and save the file.
2. Open Terminal
3. "npm run dev"
4. "php artisan serve"
